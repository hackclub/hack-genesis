# Assembling your Sprig

Your Sprig console is a piece of open source hardware and can also be used as a hardware development kit (all the unused GPIO pins are broken out!). We made it into a game console and invite you to enjoy it as such. But we encourage you to make it something else.

Below are instructions for assembling your Sprig console.

## Instructions

1. Slide the LCD screen into the socket on the top of the board.

> [!CAUTION]
> Make sure that there are no pins floating out on either end! Misalignments can cause bad things to happen. 

2. If you have one long 3D-printed part with two holes in your kit, slide it under the end of the display. Slide one of the longer bolts through the screen, spacer, and circuit board and screw one of the nuts onto the other end. Use the allen key to tighten it. Repeat for the display's other hole. If you have two small plastic tubes, place one under each hole in the display and repeat this process for each.

3. Put the buttons in the corresponding holes on the front of the board - 4 on each side. You'll have 2 extra buttons.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't worry about soldering the buttons in. The bends in the buttons' leads help them stay in the PCB!

4. Grab the clear backing plates. You should have four of them - two with a plus-shaped cutout, and two without.
> [!NOTE]
> If any of the plates have what look like circular scores where holes should be, use a bolt to push the piece through.

Peel the plastic film off both sides of each piece.

Now flip over your Sprig and stack two plates on one side of the board - first one with the plus-shaped cutout for the D-pad, then one of the solid ones.

> [!TIP]
> If it's hard to get the plates to stay lined up, you can put one bolt through the plates first, then put the bolt in the corresponding hole in the PCB.

5. Put the shorter bolts in the plates' holes and add nuts on the top side of the board. Tighten using the allen key provided. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the plates on the other side.

6. Put the Raspberry Pi Pico into the socket on the back. The USB port should face the top of the board (where the black speaker is). It might need a bit of force, but the black plastic on the Pico will be flat against the socket when it's all the way in.

> [!CAUTION]
> Make sure that the ends of the Pico's rows of pins align with the ends of the sockets! Misalignments can cause bad things to happen. 

7. Put in the 2 AAA batteries. The negative (-) side of each battery goes against the spring at one end of the slot.
