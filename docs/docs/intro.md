# Getting Started

Welcome to the Sprig docs! We're going to guide you all the way from making your first Sprig game to playing it on a real-life Sprig console!

## Making Your Game

If this is your first time making a Sprig game, we recommend that you take a look at the [beginner tutorial](BEGINNER_WORKSHOP.md). You'll probably want to check out [The Toolkit](toolkit.md) at some point too.

## Getting Your Sprig

After you've made your game, you can request a Sprig! Instructions on how to do this are [here](https://sprig.hackclub.com/get). You can only get a Sprig if you are a high schooler or younger.

## Playing your game on your Sprig

You finally got your Sprig! Now it's time to for all of that hard work to pay off! 

At the moment, all you have is bunch of parts, and you may be wondering how to put them together to make your Sprig. Our [assembly guide](ASSEMBLY.md) goes through this, with lots of images to help you along the way! Once you've assembled your Sprig, you can [upload your game](UPLOAD.md) onto it.

That's it! You've made a unique Sprig game in the Sprig editor, published your game to the [Sprig gallery](https://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery), got your very own Sprig, and assembled it. Now, you can play your amazing game over and over, try somebody else's game, make another one yourself, or even play [Doom](https://cloud-mu2xu4vzb-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0pxl_20240407_024452716.mp4)! Make sure to join the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack) and the #sprig channel if you're not already in it.

**Happy Sprigging! :D**
